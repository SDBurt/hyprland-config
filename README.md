# Hyprland Config

Playing around with CachyOS and HyprLand. Based on [this config](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachyos-hyprland-settings). Will probably update the hotkeys to be more like AeroSpace, the tiling manager for Mac.

## Setup
- To get my config like he one from CachyOS, I had to clone their settings repo and copy over the specific configs for the libraries they use.

## Thanks
Special thanks to LLM's for helping me debug the NVidia issues.
